# Real-time transcriptions of video stream

This is an app that showcases real-time-ish transcriptions of a video stream using TokBox and the experimental [Speech Recognition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition).

## Running

Clone the repository and open up `src/index.html` in Chrome.  You will be asked to grant the browser with microphone and camera access.  Please do so.  Once your image appears on screen, feel free to speak.  With some delay, you'll see a transcription of you what said appear beneath the video.

You can open up the page in additional browser tabs as well.  Subsequent video feeds will appear at the bottom of the page.

## Notes
The Speech Recognition API is experimental and is [currently only supported by Chrome](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition#Browser_compatibility).
